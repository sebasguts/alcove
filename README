The GAP 4 package `alcove'
--------------------------

This package aims at providing an implementation of matroids
and association schemes as GAP objects. Efficient computation
of their structural properties and certain invariants is a
key goal of the package, partly using powerful logical methods
from the homalg project.

All this is in an early development state and nowhere near
complete. Bug reports and other feedback are welcome. The
latest version can be found at
